# dark-photo-remover
This Python script takes "dark" photos and moves them into a labelled folder based on OpenCV average RGB channels. It
 also features an adjustable "darkness" threshold that you can play around with to fit your needs.

#### For Windows:
This script requires the opencv-python package. I recommend installing it in the general Python interpreter so you
 can run this script anywhere. Run the following in Command Prompt.
 
 `python -m pip install opencv-python`
 
_(If you have multiple versions of Python, make sure to install the package to whichever one your script will run with)_
